Django-OTH
==========

Our project is a Django-based OTH (Online Treasure Hunt) app. If you have been in college you must have experienced the thrill of participating in an OTH. Now anyone can quickly create any number of Online Treasure Hunt games with login, registration and session management built in, just by using Django-OTH. Each OTH has a leaderboard of its own that reflects the top scorers. This hack loosely belongs to the Social theme.

##Features at a glance
